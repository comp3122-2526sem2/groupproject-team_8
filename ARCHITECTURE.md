# ARCHITECTURE

This document is the technical deep dive for the STEM Learning Platform with GenAI. It complements `DESIGN.md`: `DESIGN.md` explains the broad product and system story, while this document goes deeper on runtime structure, subsystem boundaries, request flows, background jobs, and implementation tradeoffs.

## 1. Reading Guide

Use this document when you want to understand:

- how the platform is split across frontend, backend, and Supabase
- where major workflows execute
- how request and data flows move through the stack
- how background jobs, guest mode, and analytics are implemented
- which architectural decisions shape reliability, safety, and maintainability

## 2. System Context

At a high level, the project is a role-aware educational platform with three runtime surfaces:

- a Next.js web app for user experience, routing, and server actions
- a Python FastAPI service for AI orchestration and workflow-heavy backend logic
- a Supabase project for auth, data, storage, row-level security, and background-job support

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Teacher[Teacher] --> Web
    Student[Student] --> Web
    Guest[Guest] --> Web

    Web[Next.js Web App] --> Backend[Python FastAPI Backend]
    Web --> Supabase[(Supabase)]
    Backend --> Supabase
    Backend --> Providers[OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter]

    Supabase --> Auth[Auth]
    Supabase --> DB[(Postgres + RLS)]
    Supabase --> Storage[Storage]
    Supabase --> Edge[Edge Functions]
```

### Architectural intent

- Keep UI and route orchestration in the web layer.
- Keep provider logic, AI workflows, and service guardrails in the Python backend.
- Keep identity, persistence, access control, storage, and async work coordination in Supabase.

## 3. Repository And Ownership Structure

The monorepo is intentionally partitioned by subsystem.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Repo[Repository Root] --> WebDir[web/]
    Repo --> BackendDir[backend/]
    Repo --> SupabaseDir[supabase/]
    Repo --> TestsDir[tests/]

    WebDir --> AppRoutes[src/app]
    WebDir --> UIPrimitives[src/components/ui]
    WebDir --> LibDir[src/lib]

    BackendDir --> MainPy[app/main.py]
    BackendDir --> Domains[app/*.py domain modules]
    BackendDir --> BackendTests[tests/]

    SupabaseDir --> Migrations[migrations/]
    SupabaseDir --> MaterialWorker[functions/material-worker]
    SupabaseDir --> GuestCleanup[functions/guest-sandbox-cleanup]

    TestsDir --> E2E[tests/e2e]
```

### Core ownership by directory

| Area | Main responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `web/` | UI, server actions, route handlers, role-based flows, guest-aware routing |
| `backend/` | AI generation, chat orchestration, analytics, class workflows, guest AI guardrails |
| `supabase/` | schema, RLS, queueing, edge functions, guest sandbox data model |
| `tests/` | Playwright E2E coverage for high-level user flows |

## 4. Runtime Topology

The deployed system is not just “frontend plus database”. It is a coordinated multi-surface application.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Browser[Browser] --> VercelWeb[Web Deployment]
    VercelWeb --> PythonHost[Backend Deployment]
    VercelWeb --> HostedSupabase[(Hosted Supabase)]
    PythonHost --> HostedSupabase
    PythonHost --> Providers[Model Providers]

    HostedSupabase --> MaterialWorker[material-worker]
    HostedSupabase --> GuestCleanup[guest-sandbox-cleanup]
```

### Why this split matters

- The frontend can stay focused on product flows and rendering.
- The backend can evolve independently around AI logic, validation, and orchestration.
- Background processing is handled outside the request-response path.
- Guest-mode cleanup and material processing remain operational concerns, not UI concerns.

## 5. Request Flow Model

Most important product operations follow the same layered pattern.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Web as Next.js Route or Page
    participant Action as Server Action / Route Handler
    participant Backend as Python FastAPI
    participant Supabase as Supabase
    participant Provider as AI Provider

    User->>Web: Trigger product action
    Web->>Action: Submit validated input
    Action->>Supabase: Read or persist app state as needed
    Action->>Backend: Forward domain request
    Backend->>Supabase: Load class, blueprint, materials, snapshots, or guest state
    Backend->>Provider: Generate structured output
    Backend-->>Action: Return { ok, data, error, meta }
    Action->>Supabase: Persist final app-facing records if needed
    Action-->>Web: Render updated state
```

### Common responsibilities by layer

| Layer | Typical responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Web page/component | collect user input, render route state |
| Server action | authorization, validation, persistence choreography, backend calls |
| Python backend | AI orchestration, fallback, service logic, guest guardrails |
| Supabase | auth, storage, persistence, RLS, queue support, snapshots |

## 6. Web Layer Architecture

The web app uses Next.js 16 App Router with server actions as the main write path.

### Main responsibilities

- public landing and auth UX
- teacher and student dashboard routing
- class-shell navigation
- materials library UX
- Blueprint editor and publishing flows
- activity generation and assignment surfaces
- analytics and teaching-brief pages
- guest routing, gating, and presentation

### Key implementation files

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `web/src/app/classes/actions.ts` | class-level server actions including materials and blueprint flows |
| `web/src/lib/actions/insights.ts` | teacher class intelligence action boundary |
| `web/src/lib/actions/teaching-brief.ts` | adaptive teaching brief action boundary |
| `web/src/app/components/Sidebar.tsx` | role-aware persistent navigation shell |
| `web/src/app/components/RoleAppShell.tsx` | top-level shell wrapper with guest banner handling |
| `web/src/lib/ai/python-*.ts` | frontend-to-backend adapters for AI domains |
| `web/src/lib/chat/python-workspace.ts` | frontend adapter for chat workspace endpoints |

### Middleware role

`web/middleware.ts` centralizes route protection and guest-session enforcement.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[Incoming request] --> CheckAuth{Authenticated?}
    CheckAuth -- No --> LoginRedirect[Redirect to login]
    CheckAuth -- Yes --> CheckGuest{Anonymous guest?}
    CheckGuest -- No --> CheckVerified{Email verified?}
    CheckVerified -- No --> VerifyRedirect[Redirect to login with verify message]
    CheckVerified -- Yes --> Allow[Allow request]

    CheckGuest -- Yes --> GuestScope{Allowed guest route?}
    GuestScope -- No --> GuestRedirect[Redirect to home or guest class]
    GuestScope -- Yes --> GuestExpiry{Sandbox active?}
    GuestExpiry -- No --> ExpireAndSignOut[Expire sandbox and sign out]
    GuestExpiry -- Yes --> Allow
```

## 7. Python Backend Architecture

The Python backend is the sole AI orchestration boundary for the platform.

### Main structural pattern

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Main[app/main.py] --> AuthLayer[service auth + user token verification]
    Main --> DomainRoutes[domain endpoints]
    Main --> AnalyticsRouter[analytics router]

    DomainRoutes --> Blueprints[blueprints.py]
    DomainRoutes --> Quiz[quiz.py]
    DomainRoutes --> Flashcards[flashcards.py]
    DomainRoutes --> Chat[chat.py]
    DomainRoutes --> ChatWorkspace[chat_workspace.py]
    DomainRoutes --> Materials[materials.py]
    DomainRoutes --> Classes[classes.py]
    DomainRoutes --> Canvas[canvas.py]

    Blueprints --> Providers
    Quiz --> Providers
    Flashcards --> Providers
    Chat --> Providers
    AnalyticsRouter --> Providers
    DomainRoutes --> Supabase
    AnalyticsRouter --> Supabase
```

### Current backend domains

- generic LLM and embedding generation
- blueprint generation
- quiz generation
- flashcards generation
- grounded chat generation
- chat canvas generation
- chat workspace orchestration
- class creation and join
- material dispatch and processing triggers
- class intelligence, teaching brief, and data-query generation

### Service-level contracts

- The backend returns the canonical envelope `{ ok, data, error, meta }`.
- It injects and returns `request_id` values for observability and traceability.
- It validates service auth and, when required, validates real user bearer tokens against Supabase Auth.

## 8. Chat Workspace And Memory Architecture

Chat is one of the most sophisticated subsystems in the project. It is not a single stateless endpoint.

### Current responsibilities

- participant discovery for teacher monitoring
- session list, creation, rename, and archive
- paginated message history
- send-and-persist workflow
- long-context management and compaction
- grounded retrieval against blueprint and materials

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Chat UI
    participant Web as Next.js action
    participant WS as chat_workspace.py
    participant SB as Supabase
    participant Chat as chat.py
    participant AI as Provider

    UI->>Web: Send message
    Web->>WS: messages/send
    WS->>SB: Load session history and class context
    WS->>WS: Build recent context and compaction state
    WS->>Chat: Request grounded response
    Chat->>SB: Load blueprint and retrieved material context
    Chat->>AI: Generate structured response
    AI-->>Chat: Response payload
    Chat-->>WS: Normalized assistant response
    WS->>SB: Persist user and assistant messages
    WS-->>Web: Updated message payload
    Web-->>UI: Render chat state
```

### Compaction logic

`backend/app/chat_workspace.py` shows that the chat workspace is tuned around:

- recent-turn windows
- context token budgets
- output token reservation
- compaction triggers
- cursor validation and pagination safety

This is a good example of moving complex conversational behavior into a dedicated backend subsystem rather than leaving it to route handlers in the web app.

## 9. Supabase Architecture

Supabase is the operational backbone of the platform.

### Main roles

- auth for permanent and guest users
- row-level secured Postgres data
- private materials storage
- snapshot storage for analytics
- queue-backed material processing
- guest sandbox state and lifecycle persistence
- edge-function execution

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Supabase[(Supabase)] --> Auth[Auth]
    Supabase --> DB[(Postgres)]
    Supabase --> Storage[Storage]
    Supabase --> Queue[pgmq queue]
    Supabase --> Cron[pg_cron]
    Supabase --> Edge[Edge Functions]

    DB --> RLS[Row Level Security]
    Edge --> MaterialWorker[material-worker]
    Edge --> GuestCleanup[guest-sandbox-cleanup]
```

### Important data model themes

- `sandbox_id` enables guest-mode cloning and isolation across normal application tables.
- canonical blueprint snapshots provide stable downstream context.
- analytics and teaching-brief snapshots support teacher-facing refresh and caching behavior.
- assignment recipient and chat workspace tables support per-user classroom workflows.

## 10. Background Jobs And Async Processing

Material processing is intentionally asynchronous.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Teacher
    participant Web as Web App
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant Queue as pgmq
    participant Cron as pg_cron dispatch
    participant Worker as material-worker

    Teacher->>Web: Upload material
    Web->>DB: Store material row and job metadata
    DB->>Queue: Enqueue job
    Cron->>Worker: Trigger processing run
    Worker->>DB: Claim job
    Worker->>Worker: Extract text, chunk, embed
    Worker->>DB: Persist chunks and mark material ready
```

### Why async here

- extraction and embedding are not request-friendly operations
- worker failure and retry behavior can be managed independently
- the UI can reflect `processing`, `ready`, and `failed` states clearly

## 11. Guest Mode Architecture

Guest mode is implemented as a real sandboxed experience, not a presentation-only shortcut.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> LandingCTA
    LandingCTA --> AnonymousAuth
    AnonymousAuth --> SandboxProvisioning
    SandboxProvisioning --> ActiveSandbox
    ActiveSandbox --> RoleSwitch
    RoleSwitch --> ActiveSandbox
    ActiveSandbox --> ResetSandbox
    ResetSandbox --> SandboxProvisioning
    ActiveSandbox --> Expired
    ActiveSandbox --> Discarded
    Expired --> Cleanup
    Discarded --> Cleanup
```

### Key implementation decisions

- Supabase Anonymous Auth creates a real guest identity.
- A sandbox row is created and seeded demo data is cloned into standard tables.
- The web layer constrains route scope and session lifetime.
- The backend verifies sandbox ownership and quotas before guest AI work runs.
- `guest-sandbox-cleanup` reclaims expired or discarded guest data.

## 12. Security, Auth, And RLS

Security is distributed across all three runtime surfaces.

### Web layer

- route protection
- email verification enforcement
- guest route confinement

### Backend layer

- service authentication through `PYTHON_BACKEND_API_KEY`
- user bearer token validation
- guest quota enforcement
- request envelope consistency

### Supabase layer

- row-level security policies
- teacher- and enrollment-based access control
- sandbox-aware data isolation for guest flows

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UserAuth[User auth state] --> WebGuard[Web middleware and server actions]
    WebGuard --> BackendGuard[Backend service and user-token checks]
    BackendGuard --> DBGuard[RLS and SQL-side constraints]
```

## 13. Deployment Architecture

The deployment model mirrors the runtime split:

- frontend deployment for `web/`
- backend deployment for `backend/`
- hosted Supabase project

This means operational failures can belong to:

- the frontend route and UX layer
- the backend orchestration layer
- Supabase auth, storage, data, or Edge Function layers

That separation is useful for debugging and for keeping each subsystem conceptually clean.

## 14. Main Tradeoffs And Constraints

### Strengths

- strong separation of concerns
- realistic async processing model
- credible guest demo path
- role-specific UX supported by role-specific architecture
- backend can evolve AI logic without reshaping frontend contracts

### Constraints

- the Python backend is a required runtime dependency
- material processing depends on queueing, worker secrets, and provider config alignment
- guest mode depends on both web config and Supabase anonymous auth
- the project intentionally favors architectural clarity over a single-deployment-surface simplification
