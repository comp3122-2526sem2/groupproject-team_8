# E2E Test Guide

## 1. Prerequisites

- Install project dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Install Playwright browsers: `pnpm exec playwright install`
- Set required environment variables (see below)

## 2. Configuration

Test config: `tests/config.ts`

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `E2E_BASE_URL` | System-under-test URL (defaults to Vercel deployment) |
| `E2E_TEACHER_EMAIL` | Teacher account email |
| `E2E_TEACHER_PASSWORD` | Teacher account password |
| `E2E_STUDENT_EMAIL` | Student account email (optional, for student tests) |
| `E2E_STUDENT_PASSWORD` | Student account password (optional, for student tests) |

## 3. Running Tests

Run a single spec:

```sh
npx playwright test --config tests/playwright.config.ts tests/e2e/teacher-nav.spec.ts
```

Run all E2E tests:

```sh
npx playwright test --config tests/playwright.config.ts
```

## 4. Results

- Screenshots and traces are saved to `tests/results/` on failure
- HTML report: `tests/results/playwright/html-report/`
- Open report in browser: `npx playwright show-report tests/results/playwright/html-report`

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If login fails, verify your credentials are set correctly in env vars
- If rate-limited, wait a moment and retry
- For timeout issues, check network connectivity to the target URL
